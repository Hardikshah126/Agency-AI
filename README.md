Everyone is starting a personal branding agency.
I built one — with AI.

Personal branding agencies are everywhere.
But behind the scenes, most of them struggle with the same problems:

Ideas are messy and unstructured
Every platform needs a different writing style
Content sounds robotic when AI is used
Brand voice gets lost over time
Turning thoughts into posts takes too long

People don’t lack ideas.
They lack clarity, structure, and consistency.

Agency.AI was built to solve this exact gap.

Instead of asking users to write perfect prompts,
Agency.AI lets them start the way humans actually think
with rough thoughts and half-formed ideas.

From there, the system shapes those ideas into:

LinkedIn posts with strong hooks and structure
X posts that are direct and opinionated
Instagram Reel scripts written in a spoken, natural style

All while staying true to the user’s brand voice and emotional tone.

Agency.AI focuses on how people write, not just what they write.

It does this by:

Adapting content to each platform automatically
Allowing users to define their brand voice using keywords, tone, and writing samples
Controlling emotional depth instead of generic “AI creativity”
Detecting reel duration directly from natural language
(for example: “30 sec reel about consistency”)

The goal is not speed alone.
The goal is clear communication in your own voice.

What Makes It Different

No prompt engineering
No platform guesswork
No over-engineered UI
No generic AI tone

Just ideas → clarity → platform-ready content.

Tech Stack)
Frontend

The frontend is designed to stay out of the way and let writing lead.
React
TypeScript
Tailwind CSS
Vite

Backend

The backend handles all the intelligence and structure.

FastAPI (Python)
Gemini as the language model
Platform-aware content logic
Brand voice injection
Duration-aware reel generation

All decisions around platform rules, tone, and pacing are handled server-side.

play around with the logic
build on top of it
adapt it for your own ideas

Agency.AI isn’t about replacing writers.

It’s about helping people say what they already know
more clearly, more consistently, and in their own voice.
